# WeMod Prefix Downloads

## DISCLAIMER
This project is *NOT* affiliated with, funded by, or paid by WeMod.  
The work done here is purely from the contributors who donate their time and efforts.  
WeMod (the company) makes WeMod (the mod tool).  
We (`wemod-launcher`) enable you to run it on Linux (and by extension, the Steam Deck).

## Info
This is the wemod-laucher branch,  
from which the ready to play WeMod Prefixes are published from.  
Check out the releases section and download yourself a `prefix$version.zip`.  
None of the prefixes are uploaded to the repo directly,  
but are added to the releases instead.

## Automated Downloads
Soon, the prefix downloads will be added to the WeMod script,  
to automatically download the prefixes from the releases tab.  
A json file containing the release options may be added to this branch too.
