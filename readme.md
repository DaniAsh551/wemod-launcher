# WeMod Prefix Downloads

## DISCLAIMER
This project is *NOT* affiliated with, funded by, or paid by WeMod.  
The work done here is purely from the contributors who donate their time and efforts.  
WeMod (the company) makes WeMod (the mod tool).  
We (`wemod-launcher`) enable you to run it on Linux (and by extension, the Steam Deck).

## Info
This is the wemod-laucher branch,  
from which the ready to play WeMod Prefixes are published from.  
Simlpy use the wemod laucher with the download option when asked to auto download the the correct prefix, without any additional work needed. 
None of the prefixes are uploaded to the repo directly,  
but are added to the releases instead.

## Automated Downloads
The prefix downloads are added to the WeMod script at this point,  
the code automatically downloads the prefixes from the releases tab.
